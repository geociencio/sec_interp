# Runtime dependencies for development/testing of the plugin.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. QGIS Python bindings (qgis.core, qgis.gui) are provided by the QGIS application itself
#    and are NOT installable via pip.
# 2. PyQt5 is also provided by the QGIS runtime.
#
# We list PyQt5 here primarily for:
# - CI/CD environments where QGIS is headless or mocked.
# - Local development IDEs (VSCode/PyCharm) to provide autocompletion and type hinting.
#
# Version Constraint:
# We pin to 5.15.x to recognize the version used by modern QGIS 3.28+ LTR releases.
# Check your specific QGIS version's Help -> About to confirm the exact PyQt version.

PyQt5>=5.15.0,<5.16.0
