      - Implemented Adaptive Level of Detail (LOD) for high-performance rendering
      - Added Dynamic Zoom-based LOD (details increase as you zoom in)
      - Added Measurement Tool (Distance and Slope/Gradient)
      - Improved CRS handling and fixed blank rendering issues
    * Architecture & Fixes:
      - Refactored services to use Command Pattern for parallel execution
