"""Core algorithms module.

IMPORTANT: The main SecInterp plugin class has been moved to sec_interp_plugin.py
in the plugin root directory to separate UI/QGIS integration logic from core
business logic.

This module is reserved for pure business logic algorithms without UI dependencies.

# The SecInterp class has been moved to sec_interp_plugin.py
# Import it from there if needed:
